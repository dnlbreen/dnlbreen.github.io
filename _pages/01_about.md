  I'm a physics PhD student at UCSD in the Abarbanel research group. In collaboration with research groups gathering experimental data, I use methods of statistical data assimilation to construct biophysically accurate models of neurons. Validated models can be used to infer properties of neurons and neural circuits that are ordinarily inaccessible or difficult to measure.
