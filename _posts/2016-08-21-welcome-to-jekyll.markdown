I hired a photographer to take some portraits in the area around Scripps Institution of Oceanography. There are a lot of scenic places to see around La Jolla and San Diego, so there may be more of these coming in the future. I found the process fun and memorable and would recommend anyone with the money to consider posting on a local photography group's Facebook page to find someone who is trying to build up their portfolio. You can usually find a bargain; around $100 for an hour is a reasonable budget price for a gig, in my opinion.
