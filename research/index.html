<h4>Research</h4>

I am developing statistical methods of non-convex optimization to estimate parameters in nonlinear systems. The aim is to apply these methods to different biomedical contexts using models and recorded data to infer difficult to measure or experimentally inaccessible properties of neuronal systems. In one case, I am using these methods to understand the causes of Alzheimer's disease. In another, I am characterizing the dynamic behavior of a neuromorphic VLSI circuit that emulates membrane dynamics and channel kinetics.
